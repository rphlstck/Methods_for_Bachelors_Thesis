# Methods for Bachelors Thesis
This are the methods I used in my Bachelors thesis.

In the file "Methods_BA.py" the functions I used for preparing, calculating and plotting the data are implemented.
This file is needed in order to execute the Jupyter notebook "Jupyter_notebook_GitHub_version.ipynb". In this notebook the plots, which occur in my bachelors thesis, were generated.

Additionally, in order to execute the Jupyter notebook the data from the LEGUS & SITELLE survey of NGC 628 are needed.
